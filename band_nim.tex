\begin{abstract}
The Backward Angle Neutron Detector (BAND) of CLAS12 is discussed. The detector is positioned $3$ \si{\meter} upstream of the target and is used to 
detect neutrons emitted at backward angles of $155$\si{\degree} to $175$\si{\degree} and momenta between $0.25$ and $0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight}. It consists of $18$ rows and $5$ layers of $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} 
by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} scintillator bars with PMT readout on both ends to measure the neutron time-of-flight from the target and the 
energy deposition in the scintillator layers. The face of the detectors includes a $2.5$ \si{\centi\meter} thick lead wall followed by a $1$ \si{\centi\meter} veto layer to suppress gammas and reject charged particles. The detector achieves a momentum reconstruction resolution of $<1.5$\% at the design momentum range.

\section{Introduction}


The CLAS12 (CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer)~\cite{Burkert:2020akg} at Hall B of the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator facility (JLab) is a multi-purpose spectrometer used to detect charged and neutral particles emitted in high-energy electron scattering reactions.Tagged deep inelastic scattering studies in electron-deuteron interactions require the detection of recoil neutrons with momenta above \SI{250}{\mega\eVperc} at backward angles.
This is achieved by a combination of a Central Neutron Detector (CND)~\cite{Chatagnon:2020lwt} and a Backward Angle Neutron Detector (BAND). The CND covers angles between $40$\si{\degree} to $120$\si{\degree} while BAND covers $155$\si{\degree} to $175$\si{\degree}.

This paper describes the BAND.  A model representation of BAND and CLAS12 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clas12band} which highlights the overall layout and scale in Hall B. BAND was installed in January 2019 and has been taken data in coincidence with CLAS12.

		\label{fig:clas12band}
\end{figure}

This newly build detector is designed to measure neutrons with momenta of $0.25 - 0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight} with a detection efficiency of $35$\%  and momentum reconstruction resolution better than $1.5\%$. It is based on scintillator bars with PMT readout. 

Chapter 2 presents the BAND design requirements in terms of time resolution and geometry, discusses the selection of the detector components, and presents results from  comparative test bench measurements of different PMTs and magnetic shields. Chapter 3 presents the performance of the detector after its installation in JLab's Hall B. A detailed overview of the calibrations is given, primarily using data from cosmic rays and a laser calibration system~\cite{band-laser}. Finally, we present the measured time-of-flight (ToF) resolutions and neutron-photon separation from data obtained with a $10.6$ \si{\GeV} electron beam impinging on a deuterium target, before
summarizing the paper in Chapter 4.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Design of the backward angle neutron detector}
The major considerations for the BAND design were the constraints on geometry and areal coverage in Hall B, the time-of-flight resolutions and neutral particle identification.
To achieve the physics of interest with neutrons in the BAND~\cite{band-proposal}, ToF resolutions below $300$ \si{\pico\second} at an energy deposition threshold of $\sim 3$ MeVee are required. Neutral-particle identification is established by vetoing on a thin $1$ \si{\centi\meter} veto layer for charged-particle identification between the target and the first active layer of BAND. Photons are suppressed by a 20 \si{\milli\meter} thick Lead wall placed in front of the veto layer. Neutron-photon discrimination is achieved via ToF relative to the electron scattering time measured by CLAS12. Off-time random neutron and photon contamination is controlled with signal energy deposit.

In the next subsections, the details of the individual BAND components are described including results from bench measurements. In addition, this section also includes information on the lead shielding, laser calibration system, readout electronics and the high voltage system as well as pictures from the final assembly of the detector.

		\caption{BAND and its close surroundings: the cyrotarget and beam line components (cyan),  BAND (red) and the central detector region of CLAS12 (blue). The beam is coming from the left side.}
		\label{fig:bandtarget}
		
\end{figure}

The geometry of the BAND was constrained by the requirement to detect backward angle neutrons and the physical limitations in the hall. 
The close surroundings of BAND are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bandtarget}. BAND has to be positioned between the target support and the central detector region of CLAS12 to reduce scattering of neutrons on material in their flight path. Furthermore, BAND had to be placed on the support cart for the central tracking detectors of CLAS12 (grey in Fig. \ref{fig:bandtarget}) and mounted from an existing opening in the floor above it (black in Fig. \ref{fig:bandtarget}). 

To meet these requirement, the overall detector had to fit within a box of 3 \si{\meter} length, 1.5 \si{\meter} height and 1 \si{\meter} depth, with a hole for the beam pipe to go through.

To maximize the fiducial volume given the physical constraints, a design of rectangular scintillant bars that are layered perpendicular to the beam direction ($z$) was chosen; see Fig.~\ref{fig:design}.
The cross section of each scintillator bar determines our position granularity in $y,z$ (vertical and longitudinal directions relative to the beam pipe), and was chosen such that it yields comparable uncertainty to $x$ (transverse direction) given the bar 
time resolutions. With a design ToF resolution below $300$ \si{\pico\second}, $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} scintillator bars were chosen to optimize
fiducial volume, granularity, and cost.

The position of the PMTs for each bar is also shown. The beam direction corresponds to the $z$-axis.  }
		\label{fig:design}
\end{figure}

The active detector area consists of 116 scintillator bars, arranged in 5 layers with 18 vertically stacked bars. The arrangement of the bars is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:design}. The bottom rows are only arranged in four layers due to obstructions from the cart below BAND.  

Three different bar lengths are used: 15 bars with a length of 164 \si{\centi\meter} (red, Fig. \ref{fig:design}), 43 bars with a length of 202 \si{\centi\meter} (white, Fig. \ref{fig:design}) and 58 short bars with a length of 51 \si{\centi\meter} (cyan, Fig. \ref{fig:design}). The shorter bars were used in the vicinity of the beam pipe. All bars have light guides attached to both sides which are readout by either Hamamatsu R7724 \cite{pmtR7724} or Electron Tubes (ET) 9214KB \cite{pmt9214} 2-inch PMTs.

The veto layer, which is installed on the downstream side of BAND, consists of 24 scintillator bars with a cross section of $2$ \si{\centi\meter} by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter}. The length of the bars and their stacking follow the active detector area such that the whole downstream surface is covered by the veto, see Fig. \ref{fig:design}. Each veto bar is only read-out on one side by a single ET 9954KB \cite{pmt9954} 2-in PMTs.

Each bar has an assigned sector and layer number. The layer number corresponds to the horizontal position along the beam line starting from upstream (1) to downstream (5) for the active area and (6) for the veto bars. The sector numbering follows from top to bottom. The middle-long bars in the top three rows make up sector 1 (red in Fig.~\ref{fig:design}). Sector 2 and 5 consists of the long bars above (seven rows total) and below (two rows total) the short bars, respectively (gray in Fig.~\ref{fig:design}). The short bars to the left of the beam hole are sector 3, while the ones on the right side are sector 4 (cyan in Fig.~\ref{fig:design}). 
Table~\ref{tab:geometry} summarizes the geometry parameters and PMTs for each sector and layer .

\subsection{Components}
The timing resolution of the scintillator bars is impacted by many factors, and each component was optimized considering both cost and the above mention design constraints. 
%Bench measurements have been conducted to select the reflective wrapping of the bars and the PMTs.
Bench measurements have been conducted to select the PMTs and magnetic shielding.
% Tests were performed varying the scintillant, reflective wrapping, photo-multipler tube (PMT), and optical-coupling-method of the scintillators to light-guides to PMTs to select the optimal combination
We choose to use Bicron BC-408 \cite{scint-mat-ref} scintillators since their properties fits our demands in terms of light output, time response and attenuation length. The bulk attenuation length of 380 \si{\centi\meter} is much longer than the bar which ensures sufficient photon statistics on both ends. To enhance reflectivity, we wrapped each bar with 3M Enhanced Specular Reflector foils~\cite{3MESR}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bench Measurements}
Bench measurements were used to guide the PMT and magnetic shielding selection. 
A diagram of our test setup and electronics is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:test_stand_setup}, 
featuring a coincidence setup between a ``test" scintillator bar and a ``reference" scintillator bar. 
Each bar has 2 PMTs coupled to its ends; the test bar has the PMTs whose time resolution we wish to study.
Both bars are wrapped in an optical reflector, and placed in a dark-box. 
The reference bar was kept fixed during all measurements. 
We used in total 5 different 2-in PMTs (see \cite{hamapmts} and \cite{pmt9214}), 
assembled on 200 to 250 \si{\centi\meter} long bars. 

The coincidence signal for our measurement is produced by a $^{60}$Co source which is placed between the two bars. 
The $^{60}$Co source produced two $\gamma$ rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.3 \si{\mega\electronvolt}. 
The two $\gamma$-rays were collimated by two lead bricks to ensure they hit specific locations along the bars, 
allowing for the study of PMT time resolution as a function of hit distance from the PMT (or, due to attenuation along the bar, effective-energy observed by the PMT).

To combine measurements with different placements of the source along the bar, we use the center-equivalent energy deposit, determined by taken into accout the attenuation lenght, and normalize the PMT response to the $^{60}$Co placed at the center of the bar. Fig. \ref{fig:test_stand_posdep} shows the PMT time resolution dependence on the energy deposit for different source placements separately. Since the individual data sets are consisted within error bars, we can combine the measurements to cover a larger energy deposition range, hence we can reach up to 1.8 \si{\mega\electronvolt} with the $^{60}$Co by changing the distance of the source to the PMT.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:test_stand_results} shows the measured PMT time resolution for the different testing configurations (see Table~\ref{tab:pmts} for the PMT properties).
The lines indicate fits to data extrapolated beyond 1.8 \si{\mega\electronvolt}. 
Besides the R13435, all PMTs achieve a resolution below 300 \si{\pico\s} at 2 \si{\mega\electronvolt} energy deposition.

The test setup and time resolutions for the different PMTs for $2$ MeV central-equivalent energy deposit are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tests}.  
To reduce costs, we choose a combination of Hamamatsu R7724 \cite{pmtR7724} and Electron Tube 9214KB \cite{pmt9214} PMTs for BAND. For the veto layer, we use already available Electron Tube 9954KB PMTs. See Table \ref{tab:pmts} for details of the PMTs.

	\label{fig:resolution-laser}
\end{figure}

After BAND was assembled, we measure the time resolution as a function of energy deposit in the center of the bar using the laser calibration system (see Sec. \ref{sec:laserystem} and \cite{band-laser}). 
Fig. \ref{fig:resolution-laser} shows the results for a representative long BAND bar with R7724 PMTs. 
The resolution is below 250 \si{\pico\s} from 1 to 7 \si{\mega\electronvolt} central energy deposition, indicating the good performance of the bars and PMTs. Note, the results are not fully comparable with the source results since the energy deposition refers here to the geometric mean of both PMTs on the sides and the time resolution to the bar and not a single PMT.

\subsubsection{PMT Magnetic shielding}
Due to the fringe-field of the solenoid magnet of CLAS12 \cite{Fair:2020yfx}, all PMTs require a magnetic shielding. We estimated a transverse field in the  PMT region ranging {\bf from xx to xx} and a longitudinal field that ranges {\bf from xx to xx}.

 A dedicated test stand was setup to examine different shieldings.
We constructed a pair of 56-turn Helmholtz coils with a radius of 0.5 \si{\meter} in an aluminum frame that maintained {\bf coil spacing of xx}. A prototype detector consisting of a 2 \si{\centi\meter} thick, 5 \si{\centi\meter} diameter scintillator disc, coupled to 7 \si{\centi\meter} long, 5 \si{\centi\meter} diameter cylindrical acrylic light guides on each end, and PMTs. The detector was light-proofed with Tedlar and stabilized on a simple plastic stand at the center of the field assembly. 

As a baseline, we measured the TDC and ADC response to $^{90}$Sr and $^{137}$Cs sources for two different source placements at nominal PMT operating voltage and no shielding. 
The goal was to select the minimal shielding required to minimize the number of events lost and the effect on timing response as  magnetic field increased.

We tested $\mu$-metal shielding with {\bf thicknesses of xx and xx, each in two diameters of xx and xx}, as well as two pipes of soft iron. The magnetic field, amount of detector covered by the shielding, the thickness of the shielding, the placement of two radioactive sources, and the angle of the detector to the field were all varied. 

%Table xx shows the full complement of variables.

{\color{red}TODO: TABLE AND PIC FROM KITTY}
%*only the caesium-137 was tested at 5 cm. The strontium-90 source triggered too few events when not directly atop the detector.

%Magnetic field: varied by changing current in the coils, limited to 80 gauss to prevent melting
%Angle: changed by aligning PMT cradle with markers on the magnet platform
%Cover: measured from PMT face, along light guides
%Shield thickness: varied by sliding one or both thicknesses of mu-metal shielding over the PMTs. Soft iron was only tested alone.
%--------

The results show {\bf that a xx thick $\mu$-metal} shielding placed 5 \si{\centi\meter} (i.e. one PMT diameter) past the PMT faces is most effective to preserve events and minimize timing distortions. Therefore, every PMT in the detector has been equipped with such a shielding. 

\subsection{Lead shielding}
To minimize background from backward going photons, a lead wall was installed between the target of CLAS12 and BAND. This lead wall consists of individual 20 \si{\milli\meter} thick blocks stacked in front of the veto layer. Each block is covered on both sides with an Aluminium layer to simplify its handling. The lead wall can be seen on the final assembly pictures shown in Fig. \ref{fig:band_downstream}.



\subsection{Laser Calibration system}
\label{sec:laserystem}
%Due to the placement of the BAND, in CEBAF 12 \si{\giga\electronvolt} with the CLAS12 magnetic fields \cite{Fair:2020yfx} there is a lack of high-rate exclusive processes 
%that can be used for monitoring performance stability and perform calibrations.
A laser system was implemented to calibrate BAND and monitor its performance during data-taking. This 
provided a method to quickly perform various calibrations (discussed below). The design and performance of the system is described in Ref. \cite{band-laser}. 

Its installation required equipping each scintillator with an optical fiber that goes to its center and to an optical patch panel on the other side to connect to the laser system.
A reference signal of the laser system is provided by a photo-diode. The output signal of the photo diode is inverted and shaped before it is sent to the BAND read-out system. The signal is detected by the same ADCs and TDCs which are used for the PMT signals.

Each fiber is glue to the center of the bar with UV-cure glue (see Fig. \ref{fig:pic-fiberonbar}). Windows for easy access were kept in the wrapping foils around the bar. The windows were stacked with different alignments to reduce light leaks. After the installation of the fiber, the bar was intensively tested for light-leaks.

In the experiment, the high voltages for each PMT are provided by a multi-channel CAEN SYS4527 mainframe with eleven A1535SN cards with 24 channel each \cite{caen-hvframe,caen-hvcard}.

A schematic drawing of the read-out electronics and its components is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:electronic-diag}. The signal of each PMT is split to an ADC and TDC readout independently. 
The signal splitters are custom made and have been used in previous experiments at Jefferson Lab.
From the splitter one signal is sent to a 250 \si{\mega\hertz} sampling flash-ADCs \cite{fadc-manual} while the other signal is sent to  discriminators.
The discriminated time signal goes to a TDC (CAEN VX1190A \cite{caen-tdc}) with 100 ps resolution per channel. 

In total, the system consists of 16 flash-ADCs in one VXS crate, 16 discriminators and two TDCs in a VME crate and 16 splitters.  Furthermore, a trigger signal distribution card for the flash-ADCs and trigger interface boards are installed in the crates. All components are part of the standard electronics components of CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab \cite{clas12-daq, clas12-trigger}.

The detector is read-out either by a trigger from the main CLAS12 trigger system \cite{clas12-trigger} or by stand-alone BAND detector triggers usedcfor tests and calibrations with cosmic rays, radioactive sources and the laser system. The stand-alone triggers are implemented by a programmble CAEN V1495 logic board \cite{caen-logicboard}. They consist of a single bar trigger for source measurements and a coincidence bar trigger for cosmics and laser measurements. The later one is also feed to the central CLAS12 trigger system to allow monitoring of the detector by recording laser hits during real data taken. This special trigger rate is usually about 10 \si{\hertz} compared to the $\approx$ 15-20 \si{\kilo\hertz} trigger rate from electron interactions in the target.

\subsection{Final Assembly}
For the final assembly, every bar was build independently and intensively tested before stacked together. For each bar a pair of PMTs was chosen with similar gains measured in the lab.
Each bar undergo the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gluing of PMTs to light guides with xx glue.
\item Gluing of light guides/PMTs on bars with UV curing glue.
\item Wrapping of bar and lightguides with Enhanced Specular Reflector \cite{3MESR}.
\item Wrapping of bar and lightguides with black xx thick Tedlar foil.
\item Testing of PMTs and dark currents with pico-ammeter, possibly fixing light leaks.
\item Installation of optical fiber in the center of the bar
\item Installation of mu-shield on PMTs and light guides
\item Second testing of PMTs and light leaks
\item Installation of bar in BAND support frame
\item Final testing for light leaks
\end{enumerate}
Fig. \ref{fig:barassembly} shows pictures of the bars from first wrapping with ESR foil (left) to the final stack of bars (right). The pictures in between show a full wrapped bar with an installed optical fiber (middle left) and the bottom row of BAND (middle right).

\section{Performance}
%%% ----------------- Gain matching subsection
In this chapter, we first describe the performance of every bar and the necessary calibration steps to achieve it. Especially, a set of timing calibrations is necessary to achieve the required time of flight resolution of better than 300 \si{\pico\s}.
In the second part of the chapter, the performance of the whole BAND detector is shown with a focus on neutron identification and efficiency.
\subsection{Individual bar performance}
\subsubsection{Gain matching}
In order to have similar response to a given energy deposit across all PMTs of BAND, each PMT's HV was optimized using
cosmic rays. Multiple data sets with varying PMT HV were taken with cosmic rays, and combined to produce a gain curve for 
each PMT. These data was collected with a cosmic trigger which required a cosmic ray passing through an individual layer of BAND to get almost only rays passing BAND vertically.
%NEXT SENTENCE ARE FROM OR's comment. Double check with EFRAIN
We select events when the cosmic ray passes through the center of the detector. This corresponds to a relatively high energy deposition of 14.2 \si{\mega\eV}. For each HV setting we fit 
the ADC spectrum with a Landau distribution and an exponential background to obtain the cosmic peak position. A representative ADC spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:adc-spectrum}.
The obtained gain curve for this PMT is shown in \ref{fig:gain-curve}. The dashed lines indicate the final HV setting to position the cosmic peak at ADC channel 15,000, which was choosen to have sufficient range for neutrons which deposit less energy than the cosmic rays and to avoid signal overflows in the sampling FADCs dominating above ADCs of 20,000.

Each PMT gain curve was fit with a power law with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The value of the fit parameters for each PMT are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:gain}. The Hamamatsu R7724 PMTs (red) show are more uniform gain performance than the two ET PMTs, 9954KB (green) and 9214KB (blue)\footnote{We obtained similar results when using the pulse amplitude of the ADC signal instead of the integral}. This was also observed in bench measurements when the PMT gains were measured to pair PMTs with similar gains for each bar.
However, the peak of the cosmic rays are well aligned after adjusting the HV based on the obtained gain curves (see Fig. \ref{fig:hv_settings}).

%%% ----------------- Energy deposit subsection
\subsubsection{Energy deposit calibration}
\label{sec:energydeposit}
\begin{figure}[tbh]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{co-compton.png}
		\caption{TO DO: PICTURE UPDATE: ADC spectrum for a $^{60}$Co placed on the center of the bar along with the fit of the Compton edge.}
	\label{fig:compton_edge}
\end{figure}

The ADC response of each PMT is converted to \si{\mega\electronvolt} energy deposition by measuring the response to 
multiple radioactive sources. The sources $^{60}$Co, $^{22}$Na, $^{137}$Cs were chosen due to the gamma rays that have 
Compton edges of $0.963$ and $1.118$, $0.477$, and, $1.062$ and $0.341$, respectively (in \si{\mega\electronvolt}). The 
response to each source was measured in the center of the bar. Using the ADC response to all sources, in combination with the 
attenuation length of the bar, the ADC response can be converted to \si{\mega\electronvolt}. These measurements were done after the detector was gain matched (see previous section)

A typical response of a PMT to  $^{60}$Co is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:compton_edge} along with a fit of the Compton edge by a parametrization desribed in [ADD REF]. The extracted Compton edges for various bars are quite similar which also shows the a good gain matching obtained with cosmics, see Fig. \ref{fig:edge_bars}. Taking into account the results from cosmic ray and  source measurement, we obtain a ADC to MeV conversion function with a linear fit, see Fig. \ref{fig:mev_conversion}.

%%% ----------------- Time-walk subsection
\subsubsection{Time-walk calibration}
Time-walk calibrations were performed with the laser system \cite{band-laser}. A motorized fiber optic attenuator is used to vary
the amount of light delivered to each bar. Waveforms and times are measured as the attenuator scans from $40$ \si{\decibel} to $0$ 
\si{\decibel}. Time-walk curves and calibrations are taken per PMT. The laser pulse, immediately after fiber-coupling, is initially 
split with $90\%$ going to the attenuator, and $10\%$ going to a photodiode used as a reference time for any calibrations 
performed with the laser system.

Dependence of a typical PMT time to pulse height is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_walk} (left). To correct for time-walk, we parameterize 
this dependence on pulse height, $A$, as:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		t_*(A)	&= \alpha + \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\textrm{A}}}.				
		\label{eqn:time_walk}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
The residual after time-walk correction, $t-t_*$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_walk} (right). At pulse heights close to threshold, the 
parameterization is not flexible enough and under-estimates the strong dependence on pulse height. However, signals with pulse 
heights this low are not of interest, as a software cut on minimum energy deposition is needed to improve signal-to-background 
which removes these pulses (discussed in Section \ref{sec:neutronidentification}).

\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Effective velocity subsection
\subsubsection{Effective velocity}
The relative time delays between PMTs on the same bar, and the speed-of-light in that bar, are extracted using cosmic ray 
data after time-walk calibrations are done for each PMT. The width of the relative timing distribution between the left and 
right PMT on a given bar is used to extract the effective velocity in a bar knowing the length of the bar,
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		t_L - t_R 	= -\frac{2x}{v}							\\
		 -\frac{L}{v}	\leq 	t_L - t_R 	\leq \frac{L}{v},				
		 \label{eqn:eff_vel}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

and the relative time offset is given by the center of the distribution (see Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_vel} left). The obtained effective velocities for each bar are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_vel} (right) distinguished between short bars (red) and long bars (blue). The observed difference is due to geometrical effects from the different bar length.

The differences in effective velocities between long bars (blue) and short bars (red) are probably due to geometrical effects from the different bar length.}
	\label{fig:eff_vel}
\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Attenuation length subsection
\subsubsection{Attenuation length}
The attenuation length of the scintillator material is extracted with cosmic ray data by using the 
amplitude ($A$) and time measured by both PMTs in the bar:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		A_L(x) &= A_0 e^{-\frac{1}{\mu}\left(L/2-x\right) }				\\
		A_R(x) &= A_0 e^{-\frac{1}{\mu}\left(L/2+x\right) }				\\
		R(x) \equiv \ln{\frac{A_L(x)}{A_R(x)}} &= \frac{2x}{\mu},					
		 \label{eqn:atten}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x=-\frac{v}{2}(t_L - t_R)$. The attenuation length $\mu$ is extracted from the slope of $R(x)$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:atten} (left) for a typical $R(x)$ plot of a bar.
The slope of the central part is linearly fit to obtained the attenuation length, see Fig.~\ref{fig:atten} (right). 
The plateau shape of the amplitude ratio closer to the edge of the bar is probably induced by reflections at the light guides.   
 {\color{red} TODO: A comparison of the attenuation lengths of all bars can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:atten_allbars} }.
 {\color{red} Shall we add more details?  Comparision how does it look with the ADC integral? }.

	\label{fig:atten}
\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Bar offsetts subsection
\subsubsection{Individual Bar offsets}
After all bars are individually calibrated, relative time delays between bars can still remain, and require correction to combine 
statistics from all bars. The alignment of all bars can be done quickly using the laser calibration system, as the laser pulse arrival 
time to each bar should be within timing resolution. Any residual offset 
between bars can be corrected later by using the photon arrival time to the bars with production data. 
However, obtaining bar alignment with only production data 
requires high-statistics datasets due to the backward-angle placement of the BAND. 

Using data taken with the laser calibration system, bar alignment is done on the average time of a given bar, 
$t_{avg,i} = \frac{1}{2} \left(t_L + t_R\right)_i$. An offset is extracted for each bar relative to a reference bar in it's 
layer, and each reference bar relative to the most downstream layer. For example, the alignment for bar $i$ in layer
$j$ is done as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		\mathcal{O}^{ij} 	&= \braket{ t_{avg}^i - t_{avg}^{j}  }				\\
		\mathcal{O}^{j} 		&= \braket{ t_{avg}^j - t_{avg}^{ref}  }				\\
		t^{i,j}_{corr} 		&=  t_{avg}^i - \mathcal{O}^{ij}  - \mathcal{O}^{j},
		\label{eqn:bar_offsets}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ t_{avg}^{ref}$ is the average time of the global reference bar chosen on the most downstream layer of BAND, and
$t_{avg}^j$ is the average time of the reference bar chosen in layer $j$. Then only one global offset is needed to correct the
offset of $t_{avg}^j$ if there are no residual offsets between bars. Fig~\ref{fig:bar_off} shows a typical relative timing distribution of the bar with respect to a reference bar 
in the same layer, as a function of pulse amplitude. The mean of this distribution is $\mathcal{O}^{ij}$ for this bar, and the 
parameter's independence of pulse amplitude ensures the time-walk is well controlled.

	\label{fig:bar_off}
\end{figure}

\subsection{BAND performance} 
%%% ----------------- Global offset subsection
\subsubsection{Global offset}
\label{sec:global_offset}
A final global time offset is required to align the BAND with production data. Due to low rates in the angular coverage of the BAND, 
high-statistics data files must be used. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:final_offset} (left) the time of flight spectrum is shown for each bar applying all calibrations described in the previous sections. The spectrum is zoomed to the area of the photon peak which is used to determine the final global time offset calibration for each bar. The two peaks are the two groups of long and short bars which have different length of fiber optic cable installed. Fig.~\ref{fig:final_offset} (right) displays the time difference between the expected photon arrival time and the measured time corrected for the global offsets for all bars. One can see that after the corrections all bars are well aligned in time.

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Time of Flight resolution}
\label{sec:tofresolution}

{\color{red} TODO: Update Laser picture with layer 5. Update Photon picture to use TDC instead of FADC. Update some text.}
The time-of-flight resolution of the detector are obtained by the laser calibration data and from the photon peak in data with beam. The laser data allows a scan of the time resolution over the whole energy deposition range (see Fig. \ref{fig:resolution-laser}) from 0.5 to 7 \si{\mega\electronvolt}. The resolutions are obtained from a Gaussian fit of the difference of the mean time of a bar to a reference bar as a function of ADC or energy deposit using the calibration from Section \ref{sec:energydeposit}).


Fig.~\ref{fig:tof_resolution} shows the obtained ToF resolutions for each bar. 
In addition, an minimum energy deposition cut has been applied to remove events which are not of interest in the physics analysis. One can see that all bars are below the design resolution of
300 \si{\pico\s}.

The neutron identification for production data is done by cuts on time-of-flight. Fig.~\ref{fig:tof} shows such a spectrum of events from production data where an electron was measured in coincidence in CLAS12 in the reaction $ed \rightarrow e'nX$. In addition, a minimum energy deposition cut of 5 \si{\MeV/\clight} has been applied for BAND hits. One can clearly see two separated peaks for photons and neutrons over a flat background from accidentals. The neutron peak corresponds to momenta between $200$ and $600$ \si{\MeV/\clight}.
The neutron selection in the physics analysis is based on $\beta$ or ToF per pathlength (inverse $\beta$).

\section{Summary}
The details and performance of the Backward Neutron Detector is presented in this paper. The detector is currently installed in front of the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Lab to measure neutrons with momenta between $0.25$ and $0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight}.  It consists of scintillator bars with PMT readout on both ends.
After various calibrations a time of flight resolution of better than 300 \si{\pico\s} has been obtained for each scintillator bar consisted with design expectations from test measurements of components. A clear separation of backward going photons and neutrons reaching the detector can be seen in time of flight spectra for events where an electron is detected in CLAS12 of the reaction $e+d \rightarrow e'+X$, hence showing the excellent performance of the detector during the experiment.

The expected neutron efficiency from simulation is $35$\% . In the future, an analysis of data from exclusive $ed \rightarrow e'pn$ events collected at Jefferson Lab will allow to verify the expected efficiency.
