\begin{abstract}
The Backward Angle Neutron Detector (BAND) of CLAS12 is discussed. The detector is positioned $3$ \si{\meter} upstream of the target and is used to 
detect neutrons emitted at backward angles of $155$\si{\degree} to $175$\si{\degree} and momenta between $0.25$ and $0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight}. It consists of $18$ rows and $5$ layers of $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} 
by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} scintillator bars with PMT readout on both ends to measure the neutron time-of-flight from the target and the 
energy deposition in the scintillator layers. The face of the detectors includes a $2.5$ \si{\centi\meter} thick lead wall followed by a $1$ \si{\centi\meter} veto layer to suppress gammas and reject charged particles. The detector achieves a  detection efficiency of 
$35$\% at xx \si{\MeV/\clight} with a momentum reconstruction resolution of $<1.5$\%.

\section{Introduction}


The CLAS12 (Cebaf Large Angle Spectrometer) \cite{Burkert:2020akg} at HallB of the Thomas Jefferson National Acclerator facility (JLab) is a multi-purpose spectrometer used to detect charged and neutral particles. It covers angles from xx to xx and momenta from xx to xx for the different particles. 
Tagged deep inelastic scattering studies in $ed$ reactions require the detection of recoil neutrons with momenta above \SI{250}{\mega\eVperc} at backward angles. Therefore, a new detector has been build to detect these neutrons, the Backward Angle Neutron Detector (BAND). A model representation of BAND and CLAS12 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:clas12band} to highlight the overall layout and scale in HallB. BAND was installed in January 2019 and has been taken data in coincidence with CLAS12.

\begin{figure}[t!]

		\caption{Model representation of CLAS12 and BAND in HallB at Jefferson Lab. The electron beam is incident from the right side. BAND is marked in red. The overall detector system is roughly 20 \si{\meter} in scale along the beam axis. }
		\label{fig:clas12band}
\end{figure}

This newly build detector is designed to measure neutrons with momenta of $0.25 - 0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight} with a detection efficiency of $35$\%  and angular coverage of $155$\si{\degree} to $175$\si{\degree}. It is based on scintillator bars with PMT readout. 

In this paper, we first review the general design of BAND and its requirements in terms of time resolution and geometry. We then discuss the selection of the detector components,
comparative test bench measurements of different scintillators, PMTs and magnetic shields. In the following chapter, we present the performance of the detector after its installation in JLab's HallB. A detailed overview of the calibrations is given using mainly data from cosmic rays and a laser calibration system \cite{band-laser}. Finally, we present the measured time-of-flight (TOF) resolutions and neutron-photon separation from  data obtained with a $10.6$ \si{\GeV} electron beam impinding on a deuterium target.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Design of the backward angle neutron detector}
The major considerations for the BAND design were the constraints on geometry and areal coverage in HallB, the time-of-flight resolutions and neutral particle identification.
To achieve the physics of interest with neutrons in the BAND \cite{band-proposal}, ToF resolutions below $300$ \si{\pico\second} at an energy deposition threshold of $xx \mathrm{MeVee}$ are required. Neutral-particle identification is established by vetoing on a thin $1$ \si{\centi\meter} veto layer for charged-particle identification between the target and the first active layer of BAND. Neutron-photon discrimination is achieved with ToF separation given the design 
timing resolutions. Furthermore, off-time random neutron contamination can be controlled with signal energy deposit. {\color{red} Any need to mention 
the raw rates that we need to handle in CLAS12?} .

In the next subsections, the details of the individual BAND components are described including results from bench measurements. In addition, this section also includes information on the readout electronics and the high voltage system as well as pictures from the final assembly of the detector.

		\caption{BAND and its close surroundings: the cyrotarget and beam line components (cyan),  BAND (red) and the central detector region of CLAS12 (blue). The beam is coming from the left side.}
		\label{fig:bandtarget}
		
\end{figure}

The geometry of the BAND was constrained by the requirement to detect backward angle neutrons and the physical limitations in the hall. 
The close surroundings of BAND are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:bandtarget}. BAND has to be positioned between the target support and the central detector region of CLAS12 to reduce scattering of neutrons on material in their flight path. Furthermore, BAND had to be placed on the support cart for the central tracking detectors of CLAS12 (grey in Fig. \ref{fig:bandtarget}). 
To fulfill all physical limitations, the overall detector had to be within a box of about 3 \si{\meter} length, 1.5 \si{\meter} height and 1 \si{\meter} depth with a spared region for the beam pipe.

To maximize the fiducial volume given the physical constraints, a design of rectangular scintillant bars that are layered perpendicular to the beam direction ($z$) was chosen; see Fig.~\ref{fig:design}.
The cross section of each scintillator bar determines our position granularity in $y,z$ (vertical and longitudinal direction), and was chosen such that it yields comparable uncertainty to $x$ (horizontal direction) given the bar 
time resolutions. With a design ToF resolution below $300$ \si{\pico\second}, $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter} scintillator bars were chosen to optimize
fiducial volume, granularity, and cost.

The position of the PMTs for each bar is also shown. The beam direction corresponds to the $z$-axis.  }
		\label{fig:design}
\end{figure}

The active detector area consists of 116 scintillator bars, arranged in 5 layers with 18 vertically stacked bars. The arrangement of the bars is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:design}. The bottom rows are only arranged in four layers due to obstructions from the cart below BAND.  Three different long bars are used in the detector: 15 bars with a length of 164 \si{\centi\meter} (red, Fig. \ref{fig:design}), 43 bars with a length of 202 \si{\centi\meter} (white, Fig. \ref{fig:design}) and 58 short bars with a length of 51 \si{\centi\meter} (cyan, Fig. \ref{fig:design}) to allow for the spared region for the beam pipe. All bars have light guides attached to both sides which are connected to either Hamamatsu R7724 \cite{pmtR7724} or Electron Tubes (ET) 9214 \cite{pmt9214} 2-in PMTs for read-out.

The veto layer, which is installed on the downstream side of BAND, consists of 24 scintillator bars with a cross section of $2$ \si{\centi\meter} by $7.2$ \si{\centi\meter}. The length of the bars and the stacking follow the active detector area such that the whole downstream surface is covered by the veto, see Fig. \ref{fig:design}. Each bar is only read-out on one side by ET 9954KB \cite{pmt9954} 2-in PMTs.

Each bar has an assigned sector and layer number. The layer number corresponds to the horizontal position along the beam line starting from upstream (1) to downstream (5) for the active area and (6) for all veto bars. The sector numbering follows from top to bottom. The middle-long bars in the top three rows make up sector 1. Sector 2 and 5 are consisting of the long bars above (seven rows total) and below (two rows total) the short bars, respectively. The short bars to the left of the beam hole are sector 3, while the ones on the right side are sector 4. Table 
\ref{tab:geometry} summarizes the geometry parameters and PMTs for each sector and layer .

\subsection{Components}
The timing resolution of the scintillator bars is impacted by many factors, and each component was optimized considering the design constraint and cost. Tests were 
performed varying the scintillant, reflective wrapping, photo-multipler tube (PMT), and optical-coupling-method of the scintillators to light-guides to PMTs to select the optimal combination

A diagram of our test setup and electronics is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:test_stand_setup}. For the test bench measurements, we used a coincidence setup between a ``test" scintillator bar and a ``reference" scintillator bar. Each bar has 2 PMTs 
coupled to the ends; the test bar has the PMTs which we wish to measure the time resolution. Both bars are wrapped in an optical reflector, and placed in a dark-box. The reference bar was kept fixed during all measurements. The tested combination of components and results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tests}. 

The coincidence signal for our measurement is produced by a $^{60}$Co source which is placed between the two bars. $^{60}$Co produced  
two $\gamma$ rays with energies of 1.17  and  1.3 \si{\mega\electronvolt}. The two $\gamma$-rays are collimated by two lead bricks to hit specific locations along the bars, allowing for the 
study of PMT time resolution as a function of distance from the PMT (or, due to attenuation along the bar, effective-energy observed by the PMT).

\subsection{Magnetic shielding}
Due to the fringe-field of the solenoid magnet of CLAS12 \cite{Fair:2020yfx}, all PMTs require a magnetic shielding. We estimated a transverse field in the  PMT region ranging from xx to xx and a longitudinal field that ranges from xx to xx. As dedicated test stand was setup to test different shieldings.

We constructed a pair of 56-turn Helmholtz coils with a radius of 0.5 \si{\meter} in an aluminium frame that maintained coil spacing of xx. A prototype detector consisting of a 2 \si{\centi\meter} thick, 5 \si{\centi\meter} diameter scintillator disc, coupled to 7 \si{\centi\meter} long, 5 \si{\centi\meter} diameter cylindrical acrylic light guides on each end, and PMTs. The detector was light-proofed with Tedlar and stabilized on a simple plastic stand at the center of the field assembly. 

As a baseline, we measured the TDC and ADC response to $^{90}$Sr and $^{137}$Cs sources for two different source placements at nominal PMT operating voltage and no shielding. 
The goal was to select the minimal shielding required to minimize the number of events lost and the effect on timing response as  magnetic field increased.

We tested $\mu$-metal shielding with thicknesses of xx and xx, each in two diameters of xx and xx, as well as two pipes of soft iron. The magnetic field, amount of detector covered by the shielding, the thickness of the shielding, the placement of two radioactive sources, and the angle of the detector to the field were all varied. 

Table xx shows the full complement of variables.

{\color{red}MISSING TABLE AND PIC FROM KITTY:}
%*only the caesium-137 was tested at 5 cm. The strontium-90 source triggered too few events when not directly atop the detector.

%Magnetic field: varied by changing current in the coils, limited to 80 gauss to prevent melting
%Angle: changed by aligning PMT cradle with markers on the magnet platform
%Cover: measured from PMT face, along light guides
%Shield thickness: varied by sliding one or both thicknesses of mu-metal shielding over the PMTs. Soft iron was only tested alone.
%--------

The results show that a xx thick $\mu$-metal shielding placed 5 \si{\centi\meter} (i.e. one PMT diameter) past the PMT faces is most effective to preserve events and minimize timing distortions. Therefore, every PMT in the detector has been equipped with such a shielding. 

\subsection{Lead shielding}
To minimize background from backward going photons, a lead wall was installed between the target of CLAS12 and BAND. This lead wall consists of individual 20 \si{\milli\meter} thick blocks stacked in front of the veto layer. Each block is covered on both sides with an Aluminium layer to simplify its handling.

\subsection{Laser Calibration system}
%Due to the placement of the BAND, in CEBAF 12 \si{\giga\electronvolt} with the CLAS12 magnetic fields \cite{Fair:2020yfx} there is a lack of high-rate exclusive processes 
%that can be used for monitoring performance stability and perform calibrations.
A laser system was implemented to calibrate BAND and monitor its performance during data-taking. This 
provided a method to quickly perform various calibrations (discussed below). The design and performance of the system is described in Ref. \cite{band-laser}. 
Its installation required equipping each scintillator with an optical fiber that goes to its center and to an optical patch panel on the other side to connect to the laser system.
A reference signal of the laser system is provided by a photo-diode. The output signal of the photo diode is inverted and shaped before it is sent to the BAND read-out system. The signal is detected by the same ADCs and TDCs which are used for the PMT signals.

%%% ----------------- Electronics subsection
\subsection{Electronics and DAQ}
In the experiment, the high voltages for each PMT are provided by a multi-channel CAEN SYS4527 mainframe with eleven A1535SN cards with 24 channel each \cite{caen-hvframe,caen-hvcard}.

A schematic drawing of the read-out electronics and its components is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:electronic-diag}. The signal of each PMT is split to an ADC and TDC readout independently. 
The signal splitters are custom made and have been used in previous experiments at Jefferson Lab (REF HPS).
From the splitter one signal is sent to a 250 \si{\mega\hertz} sampling flash-ADCs \cite{fadc-manual} while the other signal is sent to  discriminators [ADD REF].
The discriminated time signal goes to a TDC (CAEN VX1190A \cite{caen-tdc}) with 100 ps resolution per channel. 
In total, the system consists of 16 flash-ADCs in one VXS crate, 16 discriminators and two TDCs in a VME crate and 16 splitters.  Furthermore, a trigger signal distribution card for the flash-ADCs and trigger interface boards are installed in the crates. All components are part of the standard electronics components of CLAS12 at Jefferson Lab \cite{clas12-daq, clas12-trigger}.

The detector is read-out either by a trigger from the main CLAS12 trigger system \cite{clas12-trigger} or by stand-alone BAND detector triggers usedcfor tests and calibrations with cosmic rays, radioactive sources and the laser system. The stand-alone triggers are implemented by a programmble CAEN V1495 logic board \cite{caen-logicboard}. They consist of a single bar trigger for source measurements and a coincidence bar trigger for cosmics and laser measurements. The later one is also feed to the central CLAS12 trigger system to allow monitoring of the detector by recording laser hits during real data taken. This special trigger rate is usually about 10 \si{\hertz} compared to the $\approx$ 15-20 \si{\kilo\hertz} trigger rate from electron interactions in the target.

\section{Performance}
%%% ----------------- Gain matching subsection
In this chapter, we first describe the performance of every bar and the necessary calibration steps to achieve it. Especially, a set of timing calibrations is necessary to achieve the required time of flight resolution of better than 300 \si{\pico\s}.
In the second part of the chapter, the performance of the whole BAND detector is shown with a focus on neutron identification and efficiency.
\subsection{Individual bar performance}
\subsubsection{Gain matching}
{\color{red} Should we add more detaill like FTOF does -- what value for cosmic did we match to / why...?}
In order to have similar response to a given energy deposit across all PMTs of BAND, each PMT's HV was optimized using
cosmic rays. Multiple data sets with varying PMT HV were taken with cosmic rays, and combined to produce a gain curve for 
each PMT. 
%NEXT SENTENCE ARE FROM OR's comment. Double check with EFRAIN
We select events when the cosmic ray is perpendicular to the bar and passes through the center of the detector. This corresponds to a relatively high energy deposition of 14.2 \si{\mega\eV}. For each HV setting we fit the ADC channel of the cosmic peak to obtain the gain curves. The value of the fit parameters for each PMT are shown in Fig. xx. The final HV setting for each PMT was chosen to position in the middle of our ADC spectrum at channel 15,000 (of 30,000 {\color{red} check this number} total)\footnote{We obtained similar results when using the pulse amplitude of the ADC signal instead of the integral}.

A typical ADC spectrum from cosmic data for a single HV setting %and the resulting gain curve from fitting the 
%cosmic peak from many HV settings are both shown
is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:adc-spectrum}. The resulting HV settings across all PMTs in BAND is 
shown in Fig~\ref{fig:hv_settings}. The spread of the settings for the short bars (red points) stems from a non-uniform behaviour from the ET9214 PMTs which were installed on the short bars. The Hamamatsu R7724-10 PMTs show are more uniform gain performance.

%%% ----------------- Energy deposit subsection
\subsubsection{Energy deposit calibration}
The ADC response of each PMT is converted to \si{\mega\electronvolt} energy deposition by measuring the response to 
multiple radioactive sources. The sources $^{60}$Co, $^{22}$Na, $^{137}$Cs were chosen due to the gamma rays that have 
Compton edges of $0.963$ and $1.118$, $0.477$, and, $1.062$ and $0.341$, respectively (in \si{\mega\electronvolt}). The 
response to each source was measured in the center of the bar. Using the ADC response to all sources, in combination with the 
attenuation length of the bar, the ADC response can be converted to \si{\mega\electronvolt}.

A typical response of a PMT to  $^{60}$Co is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mev_conversion} (left), along with the extracted Compton edge for a 
number of bars (right). The edge has been fitted by a parametrization desribed in {ADD REF]. The extracted Compton edges for various bars are quite similar which also shows the a good gain matching obtained with cosmics. 
{\color{red} Should we add more details here? Like results from all sources and a fit for the conversion? At Efrain: Didn't we use actually geometric mean and not single PMT fits?}

\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Time-walk subsection
\subsubsection{Time-walk calibration}
Time-walk calibrations were performed with the laser system \cite{band-laser}. A motorized fiber optic attenuator is used to vary
the amount of light delivered to each bar. Waveforms and times are measured as the attenuator scans from $40$ \si{\decibel} to $0$ 
\si{\decibel}. Time-walk curves and calibrations are taken per PMT. The laser pulse, immediately after fiber-coupling, is initially 
split with $90\%$ going to the attenuator, and $10\%$ going to a photodiode used as a reference time for any calibrations 
performed with the laser system.

Dependence of a typical PMT time to pulse height is seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_walk} (left). To correct for time-walk, we parameterize 
this dependence on pulse height, $A$, as:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		t_*(A)	&= \alpha + \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\textrm{A}}}.				
		\label{eqn:time_walk}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
The residual after time-walk correction, $t-t_*$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_walk} (right). At pulse heights close to threshold, the 
parameterization is not flexible enough and under-estimates the strong dependence on pulse height. However, signals with pulse 
heights this low are not of interest, as a software cut on minimum energy deposition is needed to improve signal-to-background 
which removes these pulses (discussed in Section {\color{red}4.2.3}).

\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Effective velocity subsection
\subsubsection{Effective velocity}
The relative time delays between PMTs on the same bar, and the speed-of-light in that bar, are extracted using cosmic ray 
data after time-walk calibrations are done for each PMT. The width of the relative timing distribution between the left and 
right PMT on a given bar is used to extract the effective velocity in a bar knowing the length of the bar,
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		t_L - t_R 	= -\frac{2x}{v}							\\
		 -\frac{L}{v}	\leq 	t_L - t_R 	\leq \frac{L}{v},				
		 \label{eqn:eff_vel}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}

and the relative time offset is given by the center of the distribution (see Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_vel} left). The obtained effective velocities for each bar are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eff_vel} (right) distinguished between short bars (red) and long bars (blue). The observed difference is due to geometrical effects from the different bar length.

	\caption{Effective velocity: Left-Right time spectrum in a single bar after time-walk correction for every PMT (left). Obtained effective velocities for each bar (right). The differences in effective velocities between long bars (blue) and short bars (red) are probably due to geometrical effects from the different bar length.}
	\label{fig:eff_vel}
\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Attenuation length subsection
\subsubsection{Attenuation length}
The attenuation length of the scintillator material can be extracted using cosmic ray data by using the 
amplitude ($A$) and time measured by both PMTs in the bar:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		A_L(x) &= A_0 e^{-\frac{1}{\mu}\left(L/2-x\right) }				\\
		A_R(x) &= A_0 e^{-\frac{1}{\mu}\left(L/2+x\right) }				\\
		R(x) \equiv \ln{\frac{A_L(x)}{A_R(x)}} &= \frac{2x}{\mu},					
		 \label{eqn:atten}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x=-\frac{v}{2}(t_L - t_R)$. So by measuring the slope of $R(x)$, one can extract the attenuation length 
of the bar. See Fig.~\ref{fig:atten} (left) for the typical response of a bar to cosmic ray data, and the resulting attenuation 
length obtained from the central part of the bar (right). The plateau shape of the amplitude ratio closer to the edge of the bar is probably induced by reflections at the light guides.   
 {\color{red} A comparison of the attenuation lengths of all bars can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:atten_allbars} }.
 {\color{red} Shall we add more details?  Comparision how does it look with the ADC integral? }.

	\label{fig:atten}
\end{figure*}

%%% ----------------- Bar offsetts subsection
\subsubsection{Individual Bar offsets}
After all bars are individually calibrated, relative time delays between bars can still remain, and require correction to combine 
statistics from all bars. The alignment of all bars can be done quickly using the laser calibration system, as the laser pulse arrival 
time to each bar should be within timing resolution, provided all of the fiber optic cables are of the same length to the BAND bars. 
However, the $51$ \si{\centi\meter} bars have fiber optic cables of $1.5$ \si{\meter} length from the patch panel to the center 
of the bars, and the $160$ and $200$  \si{\centi\meter} bars have fiber optic cables of $2.5$ \si{\meter} length. This residual offset 
between the ``short" bars and ``long" bars can be corrected later by using the photon arrival time to the bars with production data, 
grouping the short bars and long bars separately (see later). Furthermore, obtaining bar alignment with only production data 
requires high-statistics datasets due to the backward-angle placement of the BAND. 

Using data taken with the laser calibration system, bar alignment is done on the average time of a given bar, 
$t_{avg,i} = \frac{1}{2} \left(t_L + t_R\right)_i$. An offset is extracted for each bar relative to a reference bar in it's 
layer, and each reference bar relative to the most downstream layer. For example, the alignment for bar $i$ in layer
$j$ is done as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
	\begin{split}
		\mathcal{O}^{ij} 	&= \braket{ t_{avg}^i - t_{avg}^{j}  }				\\
		\mathcal{O}^{j} 		&= \braket{ t_{avg}^j - t_{avg}^{ref}  }				\\
		t^{i,j}_{corr} 		&=  t_{avg}^i - \mathcal{O}^{ij}  - \mathcal{O}^{j},
		\label{eqn:bar_offsets}
	\end{split}
\end{eqnarray}
where $ t_{avg}^{ref}$ is the average time of the global reference bar chosen on the most downstream layer of BAND, and
$t_{avg}^j$ is the average time of the reference bar chosen in layer $j$. Then only one global offset is needed to correct the
offset of $t_{avg}^j$ (expect, as mentioned, an additional correction is needed for the long and short bars due to the fiber optic 
cable time difference (see section \ref{sec:global_offset}). Fig~\ref{fig:bar_off} shows a typical relative timing distribution of the bar with respect to a reference bar 
in the same layer, as a function of pulse amplitude. The mean of this distribution is $\mathcal{O}^{ij}$ for this bar, and the 
parameter's independence of pulse amplitude ensures the time-walk is well controlled.

	\caption{Typcial time difference of bar mean time to a reference bar as a function of geometric mean of ADC pulse amplitude before corrections of relative bar offsets.

	\label{fig:bar_off}
\end{figure}

\subsection{BAND performance} 
%%% ----------------- Global offset subsection
\subsubsection{Global offset}
\label{sec:global_offset}
A final global time offset is required to align the BAND with production data. Due to low rates in the angular coverage of the BAND, 
high-statistics data files must be used. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:final_offset} (left) the time of flight spectrum is shown for each bar applying all calibrations described in the previous section. The spectrum is zoomed to the area of the photon peak which is used to determine the final global time offset calibration. The two peaks are the two groups of long and short bars which have different length of fiber optic cable installed. Therefore, a global offset is determined for each group independently assuming the known time of flight for photons. Fig.~\ref{fig:final_offset} (right) displays the time difference between the expected photon arrival time and the measured time corrected for the global offsets for all bars. One can see that after the corrections all bars are well aligned in time.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{global_single_bar_all_runs.pdf}
		\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{global_single_bar_result.pdf}
	\caption{Left: Time of flight spectrum over all each around the photon peak before the global offset correction. Time of flight spectrum over all bars relative to the expected photon ToF after  the global offset correction. All bars are aligned.}
	\label{fig:final_offset}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Time of Flight resolution}
Fig.~\ref{fig:tof_resolution} shows the obtained ToF resolutions for each bar. The resolutions are obtained from a Gaussian fit of the difference of the mean time of a bar to a reference bar.
In addition, an minimum energy deposition cut has been applied to remove events which are not of interest in the physics analysis. One can see that all bars are below the design resolution of
300 \si{\pico\s}. 
\begin{figure*}[h!]

\end{figure*}

{\color{red} The current picture is without a energy deposit cut hence giving worse time resolution. Update Figure with an energy deposit cut.}

%%% ----------------- Photon-neutron subsection
\subsubsection{Neutron identification}
{\color{red}  TODO: update this section to ToF/m selection instead of ToF}
The neutron identification for production data is done by cuts on time-of-flight. Fig.~\ref{fig:tof} shows such a spectrum of events from production data where an electron was measured in coincidence in CLAS12 in the reaction $ed \rightarrow e'nX$. In addition, a minimum energy deposition cut of 5 \si{\MeV/\clight} has been applied for BAND hits. One can clearly see two separated peaks for photons and neutrons over a flat background from accidentals. The neutron peak corresponds to momenta between $200$ and $600$ \si{\MeV/\clight}.
The neutron selection in the physics analysis is based on $\beta$ or ToF per pathlength (inverse $\beta$).

\section{Summary}
The details and performance of the Backward Neutron Detector is presented in this paper. The detector is currently installed in front of the CLAS12 spectrometer at Jefferson Lab to measure neutrons with momenta between $0.25$ and $0.6$ \si{\GeV/\clight}.  It consists of scintillator bars with PMT readout on both ends.
After various calibrations a time of flight resolution of better than 300 \si{\pico\s} has been obtained for each scintillator bar consisted with design expectations from test measurements of components. A clear separation of backward going photons and neutrons reaching the detector can be seen in time of flight spectra for events where an electron is detected in CLAS12 of the reaction $e+d \rightarrow e'+X$, hence showing the excellent performance of the detector during the experiment.

The expected neutron efficiency from simulation is $35$\% . In the future, an analysis of data from exclusive $ed \rightarrow e'pn$ events collected at Jefferson Lab will allow to verify the expected efficiency.
